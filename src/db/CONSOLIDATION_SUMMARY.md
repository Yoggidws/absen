# Database Migration and Seed Consolidation Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully consolidated the database migrations and seeds from **20+ individual files** into **5 focused migrations** and **2 comprehensive seed files**.

## Before vs After

### Migrations
**Before:** 20+ migration files scattered across different dates and purposes
**After:** 5 logical migration groups:

1. **001_core_schema.js** - Core tables (users, departments, attendance, documents, announcements, reports)
2. **002_hr_system.js** - HR management (employees, compensation, onboarding/offboarding)
3. **003_leave_system.js** - Complete leave management system
4. **004_role_permission_system.js** - Role-based access control
5. **005_payroll_system.js** - Payroll processing system

### Seeds
**Before:** 7+ seed files with overlapping responsibilities
**After:** 2 focused seed files:

1. **01_initial_data.js** - Essential system setup (admin user, departments, roles, permissions)
2. **02_sample_data.js** - Development/testing data (sample employees, attendance, leave requests)

## Key Improvements

✅ **Reduced Complexity**: From 20+ files to 7 total files
✅ **Better Organization**: Related functionality grouped together
✅ **Complete Setup**: Single command creates entire system
✅ **Role-Based Security**: Comprehensive RBAC from start
✅ **Sample Data**: Realistic test data for development
✅ **Leave Management**: Support for 8 different leave types
✅ **Backup Preserved**: Original files moved to `backup/` directory

## Usage Commands

### Fresh Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Reset database completely
node backend/src/db/reset_database.js

# Run all migrations
node backend/src/db/migrate.js latest

# Populate with initial and sample data
node backend/src/db/seed.js
```

### Individual Commands
```bash
# Check migration status
node backend/src/db/migrate.js status

# Reset only migration history (keeps data)
node backend/src/db/reset_migrations.js

# Run specific seed file
node backend/src/db/seed.js 01_initial_data.js
```

## Default Accounts Created

After running seeds, these accounts are available:

- **Admin**: admin@example.com / Admin@123!Secure
- **Manager**: manager@example.com / Employee@123
- **HR**: carol@example.com / Employee@123
- **Payroll**: eve@example.com / Employee@123
- **Employees**: alice@example.com, bob@example.com, dave@example.com / Employee@123

## Leave Types Supported

The system now supports 8 different leave types:
- **annual** - Annual vacation leave (20 days)
- **sick** - Sick leave (10 days)
- **long** - Long-term leave (90 days)
- **maternity** - Maternity leave (90 days)
- **paternity** - Paternity leave (14 days)
- **marriage** - Marriage leave (3 days)
- **death** - Bereavement leave (2 days)
- **hajj_umrah** - Religious pilgrimage leave (30 days)

## Database Schema

The consolidated migrations create a complete HRIS system with:
- User management with role-based permissions
- Department structure
- Employee profiles and HR data
- Attendance tracking with QR codes
- Comprehensive leave management with approval workflow
- Payroll processing
- Document management
- Reporting system

## Backup

All original migration and seed files have been preserved in:
- `backend/src/db/backup/` - Original migration files
- `backend/src/db/seeds/backupseed/` - Original seed files

## Testing

The consolidation has been tested and verified:
✅ All migrations run successfully
✅ All seeds populate data correctly
✅ Database schema is complete and functional
✅ Sample data provides realistic testing environment

## Benefits

1. **Faster Setup**: Complete system setup in 3 commands instead of managing 20+ files
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Logical grouping makes it easier to understand and modify
3. **Better Documentation**: Each migration file is well-documented with clear purposes
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Sample data provides immediate testing capabilities
5. **Production Ready**: Includes proper role-based security and permissions

This consolidation significantly improves the developer experience while maintaining all functionality and adding comprehensive role-based security.
